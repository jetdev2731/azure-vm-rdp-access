# Deploying and Accessing a Windows VM in Azure via RDP

This PowerShell script automates the deployment of a Windows 10 Virtual Machine in Microsoft Azure and enables Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access.

## üõ† What This Script Does

- Creates a resource group, virtual network, subnet, and network security group.
- Deploys a Windows 10 VM with a static public IP.
- Enables RDP access through NSG rule.
- Prompts for secure admin credentials.
- Outputs the public IP for RDP use.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Open PowerShell and authenticate:

```powershell
Connect-AzAccount
```

2. Save and run the script:

```powershell
.\Deploy-WindowsVM-RDP-20250508.ps1
```

3. Wait for deployment to complete, then use the public IP and username/password to RDP into the VM.

## üßπ Clean Up (Optional but Recommended)

To avoid unnecessary charges for:
- Managed Disks
- Public IPs
- NICs, NSGs, VNet, and other attached resources

Run the cleanup script:

```powershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "MyTestRG" -Force -AsJob
```

This deletes:
- The Virtual Machine (`MyVM`)
- NIC (`MyNIC`)
- NSG (`MyNSG`)
- VNet and Subnet (`MyVNet`, `MySubnet`)
- Public IP (`MyPublicIP`)
- Managed Disk and all other related resources

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Ensure the `Az` PowerShell module is installed.
- You must have contributor rights in your Azure subscription.
